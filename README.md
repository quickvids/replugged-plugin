# QuickVids Embeds Plugin

## What is this plugin?

This plugin watches for when you send a message. It runs a simple check to see if you have a TikTok
or Instagram link in your message. If you do, it will replace the link as you send the message with
an embeddable version of the link. This allows you to watch TikTok and Instagram videos directly in
Discord without having to click on the link and open it in a browser.
